# FA205_Workshop_4

# Overview
- Looked into creating an interactive sketch that uses 3 different types of interaction
   - Button, text box, check boxes
- I experimented with ways on recording and redeploying a users input
- I made my sketch to have the user input text, which would be outputted. The format/visuals of the text would be changed depending on the checkboxes the user clicked on.
