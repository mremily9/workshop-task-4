# Overview
- Looked into creating an interactive sketch that uses 3 different types of interaction
   - Button, text box, check boxes
- I experimented with ways on recording and redeploying a users input
- I made my sketch to have the user input text, which would be outputted. The format/visuals of the text would be changed depending on the checkboxes the user clicked on.
- Experimented with fonts, text size, text colours
- Played with interactions with mouse and keyboard inputs

# Progress (Problem Solving/Code)
**Creating the idea**
I started out this workshop by planning out a simple idea in my mind on what I could do.

This lead to a simple sketch I had done to help my visualise my code and my potential outcome, giving me a somewhat goal on what I wanted to do

**Adding in the interactions**

I started out with creating my sketch canvas - referencing from the search bar example from both the workshop and on the p5.js references

This following example from the p5.js reference was heavily useful

https://p5js.org/examples/input-elements-input-button/

I then added the checkboxes, referencing from p5.js again.

Creating 4 different checkboxes and placing them according to the sketch I had created earlier

I then finished out the layout of my canvas, with a rectangle for the output and having the text that was inputted in the textbox to be outputted in it after the user pressed the GO! button

**Manipulation and Outputs**
I then added in the functionality of the checkboxes, making it so that when a user presses one of them, they do something to the output of the text in the rectangle below 

Here I made it so that when checkbox1 was checked, if it was TRUE that the checkbox was pressed, the text would be in white - and as such, it would be invisible. Using a conditional if statement to check this. I repeated this same manner for each of the checkboxes but changed what they did under the if statement.

Here was the random colour - random() was used to fill the text with a random colour

I did a similar thing for the random scale/font size 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67dd97d7-d00b-4f44-98a8-0d4a68117d14)


Then for the random fonts I made an array of different fonts, and then made the if statement to get a random number to be the index of the array to then choose the random font

**Final coding comments** 
- When coding this I didn't get any large issues or problems with my code
- Everything that I wanted to do happened and as such it was a smooth journey on coding this workshop
   - Especially with the examples - it made coding my idea to life much easier
- Perhaps, this could be a sign that I'm not experimenting hard enough? 


# Future development 
- As this was an interaction experiment, it isn't heavily visually pleasing nor visually interesting.
- I would love to try to make this look more visually interesting by changing up the colours and fonts.
- Would also like to try using the slider as I didn't get to experiment with it, yet it was a part of the workshop video. 


# Reflection
- Overall found interactions to be interesting and something I was looking forward to learning about in this course
- The coding process was very smooth - especially with the help of examples, making it the backbones of my workshop experiments outcomes
- Would love to experiment more, with more interactions and with creating things more visually interesting
